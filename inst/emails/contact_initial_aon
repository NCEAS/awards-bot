Dear %s,

Congratulations on your new NSF Arctic Sciences award %s %s.

The NSF-funded Arctic Data Center support team is here to for researchers like yourself in storing and sharing valuable data.

We are contacting you today because projects funded by the NSF ARC Arctic Observing Network (AON) program have specific requirements for data and metadata storage. The Arctic Data Center is a long-lived, publicly accessible archive that was created to help researchers meet the storage requirements.

Please note that for AON program projects, NSF has the additional requirements:
    - Real-time data be made publicly available immediately. For what data is considered real-time, please contact the appropriate NSF program officer.
    - All data be submitted to a national data center or another long-lived, publicly accessible archive within 6 months of collection, and be fully quality controlled.
    - All datasets and derived data products be accompanied by a metadata profile and full documentation that allows the data to be properly interpreted and used by other researchers.

More detailed information about what will be expected can be found at our submission guidelines page: https://arcticdata.io/submit/#who-must-submit.

With these requirements in mind, we strongly recommend that you plan to keep detailed and well-documented data and metadata records throughout your project. On our website we have some guidelines on organizing your data: https://arcticdata.io/submit/#organizing-your-data. For those who are interested, we also post regular training opportunities for hands on help on this page: https://arcticdata.io/training/.

For data collected on a continual basis, we can work with you to automate your data deposits to the Arctic Data Center. If your research will involve large data submissions (a total size of > 100 GB or more than 500 files), please get in touch with us so we can create a plan together for those datasets.

We also wanted to highlight the data portals feature at the Arctic Data Center. Portals are dedicated sites that allow individuals and teams to create a collection of related datasets. They facilitate discovery, have collection specific metrics, can include custom search features and can be branded to reflect your organization of collaboration. For more information, examples and tutorials on how to get started visit our data portals page at: https://arcticdata.io/data-portals/.

If you have any questions about the Arctic Data Center, NSF requirements, or need assistance submitting data and/or metadata please reply to this email and we will respond as soon as possible.

Good luck on your research!

The Arctic Data Center Support Team

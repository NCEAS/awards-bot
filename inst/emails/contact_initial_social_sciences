Dear %s,

Congratulations on your new NSF Arctic Sciences award %s %s.  The NSF-funded Arctic Data Center support team is passionate about preserving Arctic research. We are here to support researchers like yourself in storing and sharing valuable data. 

We are contacting you today because projects funded by the NSF ARC Arctic Social Sciences Program (ASSP) have specific requirements for data and metadata storage. At this time, NSF requires all data and metadata created during your project be submitted to a national data center or another long-lived, publicly accessible archive within two years of collection or before the end of your award, whichever comes first.  The Arctic Data Center is a long-lived, publicly accessible archive that was created to help researchers meet the NSF data and metadata storage requirements.  Please note that NSF policies include special exceptions for awards that contain sensitive data, including human subjects data and data that are governed by an Institutional Review Board policy. In those cases, data and metadata should be published with only the non-sensitive aspects of the study. More detailed information about what will be expected can be found at: https://arcticdata.io/submit/#who-must-submit.  

With these requirements in mind, we strongly recommend that you plan to keep detailed and well-documented data and metadata records throughout your project. On our website, we have some guidelines on organizing your data: https://arcticdata.io/submit/#organizing-your-data. For those who are interested, we also offer regular training opportunities for hands-on help, as well as the self-guided curriculum, on this page: https://arcticdata.io/training/.  

If you have any questions about the Arctic Data Center, NSF requirements, or need assistance submitting data and/or metadata, please reply to this email and we will respond as soon as possible.  

Best wishes with your research!

The Arctic Data Center Support Team

Dear %s,

Congratulations on your new NSF Arctic Sciences award %s %s.

The NSF-funded Arctic Data Center support team is passionate about
Arctic science. We are here to support researchers like yourself in
storing and sharing valuable data.

We are contacting you today because projects funded by the NSF Arctic
Sciences Section have specific requirements for data and metadata
storage. The Arctic Data Center is a long-lived, publicly accessible
archive that was created to help researchers meet the NSF data and
metadata storage requirements.

NSF requires all metadata created during your project be submitted to a
national data center or another long-lived, publicly accessible archive
within two years of collection or before the end of your award,
whichever comes first. Additionally, data and derived data products are
often required to be submitted on that same timeframe. More detailed
information about what will be expected can be found at:
<a href="https://arcticdata.io/submit/#who-must-submit" class="uri">https://arcticdata.io/submit/#who-must-submit</a>.

With these requirements in mind, we strongly recommend that you plan to
keep detailed and well-documented data and metadata records throughout
your project. Some guidelines are provided here:
<a href="https://arcticdata.io/submit/#organizing-your-data" class="uri">https://arcticdata.io/submit/#organizing-your-data</a>.
If you are interested, we also have annual training opportunities posted
here:
<a href="https://arcticdata.io/training/" class="uri">https://arcticdata.io/training/</a>.

If your research will involve large data submissions (a total size of
&gt; 100 GB or more than 500 files), please get in touch with us so we
can create a plan together for those datasets.

We also wanted to highlight the data portals feature at the Arctic Data
Center. If your project involves multiple related datasets, such as
those that are part of a larger research project or organization, a data
portal can allow datasets to be discovered together. More information on
how to create a data portal and examples can be found here:
<a href="https://arcticdata.io/data-portals/" class="uri">https://arcticdata.io/data-portals/</a>.

If you have any questions about the Arctic Data Center or NSF
requirements, please reply to this email and we will respond as soon as
possible.

Good luck on your research!

The Arctic Data Center Support Team

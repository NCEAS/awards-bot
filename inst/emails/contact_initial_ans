Dear %s,

Congratulations on your new NSF Arctic Sciences award %s %s.

The NSF-funded Arctic Data Center support team is passionate about Arctic science. We are here to support researchers like yourself in storing and sharing valuable data.

We are contacting you today because projects funded by the NSF Arctic Sciences Section have specific requirements for data and metadata storage. The Arctic Data Center is a long-lived, publicly accessible archive that was created to help researchers meet the NSF data and metadata storage requirements.

NSF requires all metadata created during your project be submitted to a national data center or another long-lived, publicly accessible archive within two years of collection or before the end of your award, whichever comes first. Additionally, data and derived data products are often required to be submitted on that same timeframe. More detailed information about what will be expected can be found at our submission guidelines page: https://arcticdata.io/submit/#who-must-submit.

With these requirements in mind, we strongly recommend that you plan to keep detailed and well-documented data and metadata records throughout your project. On our website we have some guidelines on organizing your data: https://arcticdata.io/submit/#organizing-your-data. For those who are interested, we also post regular training opportunities for hands on help on this page: https://arcticdata.io/training/.

If your research will involve large data submissions (a total size of > 100 GB or more than 500 files), please get in touch with us so we can create a plan together for those datasets.

We also wanted to highlight the data portals feature at the Arctic Data Center. Portals are dedicated sites that allow individuals and teams to create a collection of related datasets. They facilitate discovery, have collection specific metrics, can include custom search features and can be branded to reflect your organization of collaboration. For more information, examples and tutorials on how to get started visit our data portals page at: https://arcticdata.io/data-portals/.

If you have any questions about the Arctic Data Center, NSF requirements, or need assistance submitting data and/or metadata please reply to this email and we will respond as soon as possible.

Best wishes with your research!

The Arctic Data Center Support Team
